My girlfriend and I are in a long distance relationship between France and the US. We both have different schedules and if you add the time difference, we don’t have much time left for us 😕.

After long talks we agreed that the key to survive long distance is all about showing affection to your partner and making them feel loved.

As I have skills in IT, I decided to create an app that would help us to show affection to each other without being time consuming.

If I could explain the app in one sentence it would be :

> “*It’s a bit like **Breal** but with dares and only with your partner”*
>

</br>
<h3 class="text-xl font-bold">How does it work?</h3>

The principle of the app revolves around **PassionFruits**.

A **PassionFruit** is a picture. A picture that you take and send to your partner. But there is a twist : You have to take the picture according to a dare that your partner selected before 🤫.

So everyday, here is what is happening :

- You receive a new PassionFruit
- You configure your partner’s next PassionFruit
- You complete your PassionFruit

And it’s the same for your partner.

</br>
<h3 class="text-xl font-bold">The heart of the project</h3>

Our goal was to keep the app as simple as possible. We go on the app up to twice a day for less than a minute and we love that.

But to make it fun and break the routine of “*a PassionFruit every day*”, we had an idea of dares and categories of dares. To make it simple :

<ul class="list-disc">
  <li>- There are multiple categories (like *faces*, *creative*, *outfits*..)</li>
  <li>- Each category has a looot of dares</li>
</ul>

When you choose a dare for your partner you have the choice between 3 dares coming from the same category. They are all picked randomly.

We have a bank of dares and categories that we can improve, complete and grow at any time. Additionally I want to make it possible for users to suggest some content that we could add to the bank of dares.

</br>
<h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Conclusion</h3>

We want our app to respect three points : **Easy**, **Fun** and **Varied**.

Of course the app is free and we want the community to be able to contribute to it. That’s why we will create processes in the future like forms so you guys can help us.

Thanks for reading 🧡
